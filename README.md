This repository is a simple langchain implementation of a pizza restraunts reviewer AI agent(I've used Ollama to run gemma 3 4B param model as the central model locally) with a custom vector database implementation with chroma
some problems you can face while directly using the repository is you need developer c++(you can download it from : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp) to install ollama-chroma
and you can configure ollama from their official website and choose any model of your choice
