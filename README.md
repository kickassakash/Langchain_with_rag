This repository is a simple langchain implementation of a pizza restraunts reviewer AI agent(I've used Ollama to run gemma 3 4B param model as the central model locally) with a custom vector database implementation with chroma
some problems you can face while directly using the repository is you need developer c++(you can download it from : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp) to install ollama-chroma
and you can configure ollama from their official website and choose any model of your choice


To simply run the code you need to first configure ollama and check if it is up and running, then go the folder you just downloaded , then just try -> "python main.py"
